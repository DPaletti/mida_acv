# SMeS: Secure Mobility in eScooters
The project has two main goals:
- estimating the mass of the rider(s)
- assessing the number of people on board
# Dataset Description
The dataset contains 19 tests performed by a single driver, leveraging a pool of drivers weighing between 35 and 115kg.
Three tests were carried out with two passengers on board. 
The combinations were chosen so that the sum of their weight was comparable to that of a single driver.
